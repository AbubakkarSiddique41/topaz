How to contribute
=================

First, thanks for your interest in contributing to RuPyPy!  Contributors like
you are what make it awesome.

There are a number of different ways you can contribute to RuPyPy.

Testing your software
---------------------

Right now we know that RuPyPy doesn't implement all of Ruby, however that's our
goal.  If you try out your code with RuPyPy and it doesn't work, let us know.
The more people talk to us about a given feature, the more we'll prioritize it.

Filing bugs
-----------

If anything doesn't work right with RuPyPy, whether it's a segfault or a typo
in an error message, please let us know.  We can't fix the bugs we don't know
about!  You can file a bug on our Github repository, try to provide all the
information someone will need in order to reproduce your bug.

Benchmarking
------------

We're committed to making RuPyPy the fastest Ruby implementation.  If you benchmark your code and it's slower on RuPyPy than any other Ruby
implementation, let us know.  We take performance seriously.

Writing a patch
---------------

We welcome patches of all sorts to RuPyPy, whether it's to the docs or the
code.  You can send us patches by forking our repository on Github and then
sending a pull request.
